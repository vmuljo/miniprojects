# Reversed String Program

This program prompts the user to input a word and the program reverses the string using two methods: Original looping method starting from the back until the front and using the Stack data structure

### Observation:
From using the chrono library, I calculated the runtime of each function (orignal and stack method). 

Original: Runs faster with short words and gradually increases run time the longer the word is.

Stack: Runs slower with short words and gradually decreases run time the longer the word is.

Why?
